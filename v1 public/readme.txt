Updated readme:
- how to set options/what they do:
  - just change the value in between the "option": and the , at the end of the line
  - i.e. if I want to change "bpmMax", I would change "bpmMax": 100.00, to "bpmMax": 300.00
  
  - Options list:
    - allowHigherStarSets: allow sets with stars greater than your maximum if it's more than 1 map.
    - starMax: the maximum stars you want in a set
    - starMin: the minimum stars you want in a set
    - bpmMax: the highest bpm you would like to play at

- setting username/password/channelname:
    - open username.txt and type in your osu! username
    - open password.txt and type in your osu! password
    - open channelname.txt and type in your (case-sensitive) Twitch handle (i.e. I would write "EclipseVTuber" (without quotes, ofc)
