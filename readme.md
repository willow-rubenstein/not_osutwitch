- osu!twitch is a piece of software that started developmetn around May 2021 by Ashe Muller (aka EclipseVTuber, MaleVTuber, or whatever the fuck I go by right now)
- it has been worked on in private with a small group of streamers to test it for around 3 months now

## How does it work?
- The bot will connect to osu! using your credentials (you cannot download files directly from API anymore) to download songs
- The songs are requested through chat, and the information the bot needs from the requests is either scraped from the urls (gets song ID), or it is generated using API integration to search queries
- The requests work by usin !osumap in a chat with either an artist and song, or a beatmap url
- The channel it connects to is defined in channelname.txt
- Your credentials (case-sensitive) should be stored in username and password.txt

## How do I know this is legit?
- I use this bot on a regular basis
- It has been used by other streamers as well
- I don't know enough about computer programming or honestly, care enough, to make a virus

## Why are you publicizing such a powerful tool
- I suck ass at osu. Like I'm bad. But I love playing it on stream, and something that I thought of within the first few weeks of streaming it is that there needs to be a way for chat to request songs automatically.

## Can I contact you with feature requests for future updates or bugs?
- Yes! A link to the Discord, which includes a feature request and bug reporting page is on the latest release, and my Discord if you want to contact me directly, is Ashe#9450
