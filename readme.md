## How does it work?
- The bot connects to beatconnect's API and downloads maps automatically into your game real-time
- These maps are requested through the chat of the channel specified in options.json, and the information the bot needs from the requests is scraped from the urls (gets song ID)
- The requests work by using !osumap in a Twitch chat with a beatmap url (i.e. osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1234567#osu1231029)
- Other options, such as max/min star value of maps to download, ranked maps only, etc. are also defined in options.json

## Why are you publicizing such a powerful tool
- I love playing it on stream, and something that I thought of within the first few weeks of streaming it is that there needs to be a way for chat to request songs automatically. I knew it already existed for Beat Saber, and was literally shocked it didn't already exist for osu!, so I took it upon myself to do it. I also genuinely love sharing ways I've automated processes that usually suck to do manually on a regular basis with other people.

## Can I contact you with feature requests for future updates or bugs?
- Yes! You can join the Discord <a href="https://discord.gg/N6pBTT7r9w">here</a>, which includes a feature request and bug reporting page, or my personal Discord if you want to contact me directly, is Ashe#9450
