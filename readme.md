## How does it work?
- The bot will connect to osu! using your credentials (you cannot download files directly from API anymore) to download songs
- The songs are requested through chat, and the information the bot needs from the requests is either scraped from the urls (gets song ID), or it is generated using API integration to search queries
- The requests work by using !osumap in a Twitch chat with either an artist and song, or a beatmap url
- The channel it connects to is defined in options.json
- You can log in securely through the app

## How do I know this is legit?
- I use this bot every time I stream osu!, so if you catch a stream, you can see it for yourself
- It has been used by other osu! streamers on-stream

## Why are you publicizing such a powerful tool
- I love playing it on stream, and something that I thought of within the first few weeks of streaming it is that there needs to be a way for chat to request songs automatically. I knew it already existed for Beat Saber, and was literally shocked it didn't already exist for osu!, so I took it upon myself to do it.

## Can I contact you with feature requests for future updates or bugs?
- Yes! A link to the Discord, which includes a feature request and bug reporting page is on the latest release, and my Discord if you want to contact me directly, is Ashe#9450
